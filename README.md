## Table Features

### 1. Column 1 (Label 1)

- This column should contain a **single select dropdown** to select options from a static list. (You can define any dummy data for the list)
- Once an item from the dropdown is selected , you cannot reselect it in the next row.

### 2. Column 2 (Label 2)

- This column should contain a “**Multi select dropdown”** to select options from a list. User can select multiple options through this dropdown.
- There should be a component at the bottom of the dropdown which will let user to add a new item in the list for the 2nd dropdown.
    
    Please note that this component should rest at the end of the option’s list and not as a separate component outside the dropdown component.
